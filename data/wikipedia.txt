Fortran (previously FORTRAN) is a general-purpose, imperative programming
language that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific
computing. Originally developed by IBM at their campus in south San Jose,
California[1] in the 1950s for scientific and engineering applications, Fortran
came to dominate this area of programming early on and has been in continual use
for over half a century in computationally intensive areas such as numerical
weather prediction, finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics,
computational physics and computational chemistry. It is one of the most popular
languages in the area of high-performance computing [2] and is the language used
for programs that benchmark and rank the world's fastest supercomputers.

Fortran (the name is a blend derived from The IBM Mathematical Formula
Translating System) encompasses a lineage of versions, each of which evolved to
add extensions to the language while usually retaining compatibility with
previous versions. Successive versions have added support for structured
programming and processing of character-based data (FORTRAN 77), array
programming, modular programming and generic programming (Fortran 90), high
performance Fortran (Fortran 95), object-oriented programming (Fortran 2003) and
concurrent programming (Fortran 2008).
